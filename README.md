**Average Inventory Turnover:** **4.53**

## 📌 Overview
This analysis examines the 2024 quarterly Inventory Turnover Ratio for the company and compares it with the industry benchmark target of **8**.

### Dataset Used:
| Quarter | Turnover |
|--------|----------|
| Q1 | -1 |
| Q2 | 5.46 |
| Q3 | 2.37 |
| Q4 | 5.75 |

**Computed Average = 4.53**
(Automatically calculated by `analysis.py`)

*Note: Q1 data (-1) was excluded from the average calculation as it indicates a data error.*

## 📊 Key Findings
1. The average turnover **4.53** is below the industry target **8**.
2. Q1 turnover **-1** indicates a serious reporting or inventory error.
3. Q3 shows major inefficiency (2.37), signalling demand misalignment.
4. Only Q2 & Q4 show moderately healthy turnover (5.46 & 5.75).

## 📉 Business Implications
- Excess inventory → high holding costs, blocked capital.
- Risk of product aging and obsolescence.
- Inefficient demand forecasting leading to overstock / understock cycles.
- Operational bottlenecks likely occurring in Q1 and Q3.

## ✅ Recommendations
**Required Solution:**  
### **Optimize supply chain and demand forecasting**

Specific actions:

### Short-Term (0–3 months)
- Fix Q1 data anomaly immediately.
- Reduce overstock via targeted promotions.
- Recalculate safety stock levels for slow-moving items.

### Mid-Term (3–9 months)
- Implement ML-based demand forecasting (Prophet / XGBoost).
- Reduce supplier lead times and order batch sizes.
- Introduce dynamic safety stock based on demand variability.

### Long-Term (9–18 months)
- Establish formal S&OP (Sales & Operations Planning).
- Deploy inventory optimization software.
- Track KPIs: Inventory Turnover, DIO, Fill Rate, Forecast Accuracy.
